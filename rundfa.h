Description: Creates a DFA through a given file with the start state, accepted
			 states and other states and their transitions. It also matches a
			 given file against this DFA.
Required input: A file path with instructions for the DFA and a filepath with
				text to match against the DFA.
Output: It writes to terminal if the given file matches with the given DFA.
